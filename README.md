# VIP groups website
This is a Ruby on Rails application created to showcase the research groups under the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) program under
the tutoring of professor Winston Percybrooks. The registered students can modify the page of the group they are associated to and add 
information such as images and the publications they have made.
